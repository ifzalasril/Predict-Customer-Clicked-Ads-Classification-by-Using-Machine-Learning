# Predict-Customer-Clicked-Ads-Classification-by-Using-Machine-Learning
This Mini-Project is Part of Rakamin Academy's Data Science Bootcamp

# Description
A company in Indonesia wants to know the effectiveness of an advertisement that they serve,
this is important for companies engaged in digital marketing consultants to know how much the advertisement is marketed so that it can attract customers to see advertisements. In this mini-project, I have been assigned as a member of the company's data team.
I am responsible for finding user behavior insights from the data by creating visualizations, creating machine learning that is relevant to the company's needs, and making recommendations based on the findings.
